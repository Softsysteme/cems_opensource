# template_mobileMaterialDesign #
This starter project will help you to create "Material Design" look & feel mobile apps hybrid applications. Material Design is the standard Google android look & feel but is more and more used on any other type of platform. You can have more information about material Design on Google's web site: 

[Introduction to Material Design](https://material.google.com/)

## How to use ##
This template uses classic jQueryMobile + CTF development guidelines so you can still use the jQueryMobile [jQueryMobile](http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/)  Widget library and  [Convertigo CTF](http://www.convertigo.com/document/latest/reference-manual/convertigo-templating-framework/) to write you mobile user interface.

The Material Design look and feel is based on [NATIVEDROID2](http://nativedroid.godesign.ch/material/) from  [Godesign Webpublishing GmbH](http://www.godesign.ch/) 

This means that you can use nativeDroid2 documentation and samples to write your app. Here are some useful links :

## Specific Convertigo CTF Customization ##
Some customization had to be made to have CTF being able to use nativeDroid2. Basically these customization have been made outside the nativeDroid2 files so that if a new version of the them is available, you can safely copy the files to your project.

## Warnings and non-supported features ##
nativeDroid2 bring the n2-incude feature to include page fragments in several pages. This is useful for headers and footer for example. Although you can use this feature in your apps, you will not be able to template them using CTF. So, use this only for static HTML fragments.
